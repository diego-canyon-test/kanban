# Canyon front-end tech challenge
This project is Diego Guzman's answer to the Canyon front-end tech challenge.
It was created with Vue CLI v4.

## How to use
Default Vue CLI commands (listed below) are available, the only differences are 
- Lint on save is on by default.
- An additional command for test watching is available.

### Project commands

#### Project setup
```
yarn install
```

#### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

#### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```

#### Run your unit tests
```
yarn test:unit
```
#### Watch unit tests
```
yarn test:watch
```
## Next Steps

- Internationalization: It was out of scope for this challenge, but i18n is easy to integrate with Vue i18n.
- End to end tests: tests are always good
- Add a Continuous integration: CI saves lives
- Design: We made our best within the allotted time to create a pleasant minimalistic design, but it is always great to work with a designer to create the best interfaces.
- Add keyboard integration: Making an UI like this fully controllable using only a keyboard is though but a welcome improvement for accessibility and power users.
